- Uniformity is the important part of the code reviews. If all the coders follows
  the style code to write in a same pattern, it will be very easy to skim through
  the code. Another main part is defining the code written so anyone new can understand the code.


- Containers is a very useful tool. It will help us to create a virtual environment
  where we can only install modules or packages that we need for the project. It
  will help us with overriding versions for the modules, i.e. we can control version
  specific for the project.
